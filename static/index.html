                    <p>The A-hills home gym was born of necessity. The perfect garage wall was lined with junk for
                        years, before the
                        Covid-19 Pandemic of 2020 closed gyms around the world. Fortunately, Lowe's was still open. The
                        quaranteam
                        masked up and braved the hardware store at odd hours, worked tirelessly for three weekends
                        strait, with
                        improper tools, and no closed-toe footwear. Featuring artwork designed by a renowned artist, the
                        peak of
                        Mount Whitney and the graceful curves of the Mobious arch invite climbers to boulder on a short
                        wall in a
                        two-car garage. <em>Memberships by invite only.</em></p>
